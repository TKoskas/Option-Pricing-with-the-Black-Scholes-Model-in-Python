# Financial Options Modeling with Black-Scholes

This project aims to model financial options using the Black-Scholes model. It includes functions to calculate the price of European call options and their delta, as well as visualizations to better understand these concepts.

## Features

- **Call Option Pricing**: Calculate the price of European call options using the Black-Scholes model.
- **Delta Calculation**: Determine the delta of a call option, which measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying asset price.
- **Visualization**: Plot the relationship between delta and the underlying asset price to gain insights into option behavior.

## Installation

To use this project, make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Usage

### Clone the Repository


```bash
git clone https://github.com/TKoskas/Option-Pricing-with-the-Black-Scholes-Model-in-Python
cd Option-Pricing-with-the-Black-Scholes-Model-in-Python
```

### Run the Script

```bash
python main.py
```

This will calculate the price of a call option and visualize its delta in relation to the price of the underlying asset.
